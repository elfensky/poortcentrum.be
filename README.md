poortcentrum.be

## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

use DDEV https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

```sh
ddev start
```

to start the local server, and access the site:

-   website https://poortcentrum.be.ddev.site
-   mailhog https://poortcentrum.be.ddev.site:8026

## DEPLOYMENT

use cyberduck to copy and overwrite files on server.
yes this is a bad practice, but

-   it's a small site
-   it's easy.
-   and most importantly, I dont have full access to the server, so I can't use git or ssh and this is the only way.
